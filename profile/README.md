## Nova Hunting  
AI threat hunting for adversarial prompts and agentic workflows

This organization is the main entry point for the Nova ecosystem.

Nova is an open source project dedicated to AI security and threat hunting. It focuses on adversarial prompt detection, agentic workflow security, and visibility across AI systems.

Website: https://novahunting.ai

## Nova ecosystem

The Nova ecosystem is composed of the following components:

- **Nova Framework**  
  Core project. Prompt pattern matching and detection engine used for adversarial prompt hunting and policy checks.

- **Nova Docs**  
  Documentation repository to start using and understanding the Nova framework.  
  https://docs.novahunting.ai

- **Proximity**  
  MCP scanner built on top of Nova to inspect and monitor agent communications.

- **Nova Rules**  
  Public repository that hosts shared and community driven Nova detection rules.

## Prompt intelligence

Nova is linked to **PromptIntel**, a platform that references adversarial prompts and provides a public classification and taxonomy.  
https://promptintel.novahunting.ai

This dataset supports detection research and rule creation within the Nova ecosystem.

## Governance and security

Each repository defines its own security disclosure process in its `SECURITY.md` file.
