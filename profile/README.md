# Nova Hunting  
**AI threat hunting for adversarial prompts and agentic workflows**

Nova Hunting is the public entry point for the Nova ecosystem.

Nova is an open source initiative focused on AI security, detection, and threat hunting. It targets adversarial prompts, agent abuse, and misuse patterns across modern AI systems, with an emphasis on visibility and control in agentic workflows.

## Nova ecosystem

The Nova ecosystem brings together tooling, detection logic, and intelligence to support AI threat hunting:

- **Nova Framework**  
  Core engine of the ecosystem. A prompt pattern matching and detection engine designed to identify adversarial behaviors and enforce security policies.

- **Nova Docs**  
  Official documentation to install, configure, and start using the Nova framework.  
  https://docs.novahunting.ai

- **Proximity**  
  MCP scanner built on top of Nova, providing inspection and monitoring of agent communications and workflows.

- **Nova Rules**  
  Public repository of shared detection rules, enabling community driven research and collaboration.

## Prompt intelligence

Nova is connected to **PromptIntel**, a platform dedicated to cataloging adversarial prompts and maintaining a public classification and taxonomy.  
https://promptintel.novahunting.ai

This intelligence layer supports detection research, rule authoring, and continuous improvement of the Nova ecosystem.

## Governance and security

Each repository defines its own scope and security disclosure process in its `SECURITY.md` file.
